QuickImageCompare
=================

Quickly analyse photos comparing details between them.  

A great tool for anyone who is into photography and takes many pictures, often of them same scene to try and pick out the perfect shot.

Usage:
1. Run QIC.exe
2. Select folder
3. Compare images quickly, click on the thumbnails (top images) to move the zoom (bottom images).
4. Align the zoom by clicking on a visual point (any place) on the left image.  Then click on the same visual point in the right zoom window.  This will line up the zooms so that you can see a direct side by side comparison.
5. Press one of the hot keys to act on the left image:
	- End - Move image to "Retouch" folder
	- Up - Move image to "Keep" folder
	- Down - Move image to "Delete" folder
	- Left - Previous image
	- Right - Next image
	- Enter - Process images (moves images into their sorted folders)
	- Home - Save metadata xml file incase you want to resume sorting later. (File will auto load when you open the folder).
	

This program does not delete images, it only moves them into folders named "Keep", "Delete", and "Retouch".

I use it to quickly look through my big image collection after a shoot and compare shots side by side to look for defects like out of focus or motion blur.
If I want to keep the picture but perform some after editing in Photoshop or something I set it to retouch.
